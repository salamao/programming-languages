importance of the Doolittle method in finding the inverse of the symmetric matrix to construct the table of analysis of variance for simple and multiple linear regression. In addition it used to solve the linear equations. Because Of unavailability of this method in the statistical application of software such as Minitab and SPSS, for the programmable cods for Doolittle method to find the table of analysis of variance for simple and multiple linear regression in addition to display the two matrices of summations for X and for XY Besides to find a solution for the linear equations are written to help the researchers in this field .Also used in<br>
   1- Giving a set of orders to modern devices, so that they can come to us as a set of programs.<br>
   2- Without the programming languages, today we would not be able to use the Internet well, whether on the computer or smart phones.<br>
   3- Getting a lot of profits from working in programming and getting to know more than one of the programming languages.<br>
    Programmers use them as a number of automatic codes that increase their productivity, thus saving time and effort and increasing profit.<br>
It is also used to deal with computers and machines of this type, and therefore uses programming to make programs that do different orders on such devices, i.e. a device that we use today from computers to smart phones to robots and other devices we need to install programs on them so that we can use them, otherwise without programs We can only use our phones to perform some simple tasks.<br>
The programs that we install, including this browser, through which you read this article, are written in one of the programming languages ​​through a programmer who has knowledge and experience in the programming language used to write programs. As well as websites are never written in different programming languages, including those famous sites such as Facebook written in the PHP programming language in addition to other languages ​​used.<br>
